Engine Slot
===========

A NodeJs or Web library to _create_ slot machines.

### Philosophy

 * **configurable** any number of reels/rows must be possible
 * **testable** payout, symbols and lines must be testable 
 * **composable** no complex classes or states, all dependencies are injected
 * **less code** when it gets cryptographic, just write the comment

### Motivation

I've been working with slots since half of a decad right now. Most of the engines are (_perfectly working in production_) very complex and full of death features that honestly makes the entire projects annoying to read and work with.

With this side-project, I want to implement some of the functionalities that I have been working with and try to understand how to create better slots in the future.

## How it works

At the very basics, a configuration file is required. Understand the configuration file, which can be a simple _JSON file_ **implementing the `IConfig` interface**, which is key to run execute the slot.

## Functionalities

- [x] Create any grid layout you want 5x3, 3x3 NxN
- [x] Configure the payout on each symbol
- [x] Add any line and relative path you like (on top of the grid layout)
- [x] `Wild` Symbols (to complete combinations)
- [ ] `Free Spins` Symbols
- [ ] `Multiplier` Symbols
- [ ] `Scatter` Symbols
